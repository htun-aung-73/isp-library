## 🚀 Key Functions & API Integration

The system communicates with clinical precision through its Baserow integration layer:

- **Inventory Management**: `getBooks()`, `getBook(id)` - Fetch and display the entire library catalog or specific titles.
- **Author Relations**: `getAuthors()`, `getBooksByAuthorId(id)` - Map complex relationships between creators and their works.
- **User Lifecycle**: `createUser()`, `getUserByEmail()` - Handle secure enrollment and session management.
- **Borrowing Logic**: `createBorrowRecord()`, `updateBorrowRecord()` - Manage the stateful transition of books from available to borrowed/returned.
- **Analytics Engine**: `getAllBorrowRecords()` - Aggregate data for real-time visualization of library trends.
